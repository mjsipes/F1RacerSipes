F1Racer is an evolution of the classic racing game, where players not only race with random prompts but they can create their own.

F1Racer is currently in development. Here is a demo of the current progress.

My current goals for the project: impliment a GUI and cool html elements for the game playing page. Add a game state for "waiting to start." Will countdown for 1 minute until starting game, or until creator of game overrides and clicks start game now. Add chatroom on the side of the game where players can send messages of emojis to the other players before and after the game ends.
