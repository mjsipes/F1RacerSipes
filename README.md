F1Racer is an evolution of the classic racing game, where players not only race with random prompts but they can create their own.

F1Racer is currently in development. Here is a demo of the current progress.

My current goals for the project: impliment a GUI and cool html elements for the game playing page. Add a game state for "waiting to start." Will countdown for 1 minute until starting game, or until creator of game overrides and clicks start game now. Add chatroom on the side of the game where players can send messages of emojis to the other players before and after the game ends.




In the fall semester of my junior year, I was in a software development class. I learned java, multithreading, concurrency, html, css and sql. In the second half of the semester I was put into a team to build a web application that demonstrated the skills we were learning in the class. In one class lecture we learned about websockets, the teacher demonstrated the websocket with a simple server / client chat room. I thought it was really neat, I also saw how this server client architecture could be used to build a multiplayer game, where instead of chatrooms there are game servers, and instead of chat clients there are players. I convinced my team to do exactly that for the group project. We landed on a typing game. Ou goal was to recreat typeracer and we would call it f1racer. 

The project was hard and took me a long time to do. I spent worked from 5pm to 5am every day for the week of thanksgiving break to complete the project. The project is also my single favorite class project I have done, I think I learned so much from it. 

I learned that every time you click a button on a web page an http request is sent to a backend server that serves your request. I learned that upon page redirection the server does not know it is the same person, which is why you have to store information in the browser like a cookie or a session id. I got to implement a websocket to have the asynchornous communication and when I finally got that to work it was really exciting. I used javascript for the first time to code the game-state logic which made me think that javascript is really cool. Lastly, it was my first experience using an sql database which I used to store information about the players and the games.

I coded this project with javaservlets on the backend. This was actually a requirement. 

Now I use this project to help learn new techonlogies. After my junior year over the summer, I wanted to host this project on the web for others to use, and I wanted to rebuild it with a modern framework. So as it exists now, the project is running with a react front end, a supabase backend, and it is hosted on vercel.

I plan to continue to use this project to learn more about coding. I want to add more advanced gui elements, add ai/llm bots that you can play against and create more funcitonality.

This project has been very special and important to my learning journey as a computer science major and asipring software developer.
